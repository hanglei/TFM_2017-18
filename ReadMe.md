## Introduction

As IoT (Internet of Things), an emerging technology, starts to build a place for itself in the market, it is starting to face scalability and security problems that cannot be helped with our current mature technologies and protocols. 

In this project, a proof-of-concept solution that solves all those problems has been developed with Hyperledger Composer, which is a toolset that works on top of Hyperledger Fabric. It is a modular blockchain framework that uses a unique focus to implement a Decentralized Ledger Technology. 

By decentralizing the data storage and business logic, IoT's scalability problem is solved, and the security is solved by the cryptographic nature of the blockchain, aside from its consensus among nodes in order to achieve a single truth so that the data cannot be tampered with.

## dIoT: Decentralized Internet of Things

The project consists of a frontend, a smart contract (blockchain-backend) and a wireless sensor network as an IoT use case scenario. The application lets a user create/delete/update devices with their IDs. Whenever a sensor registers a reading over the set threshold, the smart contract emits an event that can be seen in the website as a notification.
